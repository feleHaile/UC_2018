    "# Working with Mosaic Datasets Using R-ArcGIS Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "Mosaic datasets are made up of a collection of rasters. Mosaic structure efficiently stores and manages multiple rasters for visualization and analysis. Detailed information about mosaic datasets can be found in [ArcGIS reference for mosaic datasets](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-a-mosaic-dataset.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "[R-ArcGIS bridge](https://r-arcgis.github.io/) handles mosaic data I/O  using the ```arc.open()``` function. The mosaic dataset opened using ```arc.open``` can be processed on the fly by converting it to a raster object within R using the ```arc.raster``` function. Properties of a mosaic dataset such as ```extent```, ```pixel_type```, ```nrow```, ```ncol``` and mosaicking rules. Mosaicking rules determine how a series of potentially intercepting rasters are displayed as a single raster. Mosaicking rules go beyond only visualization and can be used to stitch together different rasters making up a mosaic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mosaicking rules define how intersections between different rasters within the mosaic dataset are handled and are made up of **method** and **operator**. Simply put, **method** defines which raster will be placed on top of the other for visualization in cases where they overlap and **operator** defines how the intersection between overlapping rasters in the mosaic dataset will be handled. The information on mosaicking rules can be found under [ArcGIS reference for mosaicking rules](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/understanding-the-mosaicking-rules-for-a-mosaic-dataset.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. On-the-Fly Analysis with ```arc.raster()```\n",
    "THe first example will walk you through reading in a mosaic dataset and manipulating it on the fly. For this example, we will be using ```arcgisbinding``` and ```raster``` packages to manipulate and visualize mosaic datasets. "
