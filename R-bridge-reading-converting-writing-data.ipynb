    "\n",
    "   The **arcgisbinding** package provides functionality that simplifies bringing ArcGIS data types into R and manipulating them so they are ready for analysis. On the simplest level, the bridge allows for the easy transfer of data back and forth between ArcGIS and R without having to manually convert data sets into a recognizable format. However, the functionality enables much more, everything from advanced data aggregations, subsets, and selections, to data manipulations regarding format or projections. All of this contained within a couple of functions to make the process simple. Through the power of the R-ArcGIS Bridge, you can easily transfer data from ArcGIS to R to gain access to the wealth of statistical packages and functions that you might need to further your analysis. Once finished, the bridge allows you to transfer your data back to ArcGIS to take advantage of the mapping, publishing, and sharing aspects of ArcGIS. \n",
